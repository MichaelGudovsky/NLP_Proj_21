# NLP_Proj_21

#       https://github.com/harshraj11584/Paper-Implementation-Matrix-Factorization-Recommender-Systems-Netflix    
# The proj is an exercise to evaluate the effect of external explicit data from IMDB movie reviews (IEEE https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/imdb-movie-reviews-dataset) on the base SVD model.
# In order to run the code the follwing files need to be in the CWD (current working directory):
 1. review_train.csv
 2. positive-words.txt
 3. negative-words.txt 
 4. netflix_movies2.csv
 5. 2_reviews_per_movie_raw (directory form IMDB data set, need to download)
 6. create new file named = review_per_movie_filtered
 7. combined_data_1.txt & combined_data_2.txt & combined_data_3.txt & combined_data_4.txt (need to download form https://github.com/harshraj11584/Paper-Implementation-Matrix-Factorization-Recommender-Systems-Netflix)
